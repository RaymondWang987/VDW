                <p>We present VDW metadata (excluding processed movies and annotations) for downloading. Since VDW is quite large (over 2 million frames and 8TB on hard drive), we only release the VDW Testing Set in the first stage. The VDW Training Set will be gradually prepared, organized, and released movie by movie (or animations, documentaries, web videos).</p>
                <p>For the metadata of each sequence, we provide IMDB numbers, starting time, end time, movie durations, resolutions, cropping area, etc. We will also build a GitHub repo (Coming Soon) to release the VDW toolkits (including Video Preprocessing, disparity annotations, etc.). In this way, you can restore some sequences of VDW or build your own data from stereo videos.</p>
                <p>The downloading of metadata is presented as follows:</p>

                <p>The release of the VDW dataset is under strict conditions. Our VDW dataset cannot be used or distributed for any commercial purposes. Please refer to our <a href="https://raymondwang987.github.io/VDW/#license" style="font-weight: 800;color: #007AFC;">License</a>.</p>
                <p>If you want to use our processed VDW dataset for your own research. We provide an application form template in <a href="https://raymondwang987.github.io/VDW/#application" style="font-weight: 800;color: #007AFC;">Application</a>. You should fill in the application form and send the application to VDW's official email: 
                <a href="mailto:vdw.dataset@gmail.com" style="font-weight: 800;color: #007AFC;">vdw.dataset@gmail.com.</a> Your name, institution, purpose for using our data, and agreement to our 
                <a href="https://raymondwang987.github.io/VDW/#license" style="font-weight: 800;color: #007AFC;">License</a> will be included in the application template. You should also sign the application form with your electronic signature. We will examine your application and send you feedback on 3-5 weekdays.</p>
                <p>At this stage, our VDW Training Set is not ready, because organizing and uploading 8TB training data are extremely heavy and time-consuming. For the applications in this stage, if you need our training data and your application is approved by us, we will register your information and send you the required data when we are ready. </p>
